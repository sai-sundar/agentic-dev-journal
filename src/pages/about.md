# About This Journal

Welcome to my dev journal! This is my space to document learnings, insights, and musings as I explore the intersection of software development and AI agents.

## What You'll Find Here

- **AI Agent Development**: Experiments with autonomous agents, LLM integrations, and agentic workflows
- **Coding Adventures**: Solutions to interesting problems, discoveries, and "aha!" moments
- **New Technologies**: Thoughts on emerging tools, frameworks, and applications
- **Dev Reflections**: Lessons learned, best practices, and evolving perspectives

## Why This Exists

As I navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted development, I wanted a place to:
- Document what works (and what doesn't)
- Share insights that might help others
- Track my own growth and understanding
- Build a knowledge base for future reference
