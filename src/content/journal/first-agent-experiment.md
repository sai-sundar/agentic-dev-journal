## The Goal

I wanted to try claude code on web browser and try a few experiments.

## The Approach

I recieved a mail from anthropic a few days ago offering some credits 
on Claude code web browser. I thought I will give it a try.

    1. I opened [Claude Code](https://www.claude.ai/code) in a new tab. 
    2. Connected to my github repo
    3. Installed Github app.    
Now I could parse through my repos and perform different tasks.

## What Worked

- Asking questions about the repo
- Code review and refactor
- Documentation
- I also used planning mode and created this dev journal page.

Another thing that I tried was adding a skill in the claude settings and checking if it was 
available in the browser mode. I created a skill called repo-cleanup and imported in the 
cababilities panel. 

## What Didn't

- There seemed to be some connection issues.
- I think I might have to change the network configuration/permissions in settings

## Key Learnings

- The tool is great for seamlessly making quick changes on git repos
- Also creating new project structure

## Next Steps

- Figure out the network configuration
- Check if claude code an access web browser logs
- Find out new features

The journey continues...
