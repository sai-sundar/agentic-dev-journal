## Hello World! 👋

Welcome to my dev journal. This is where I'll be documenting my explorations, learnings, and musings as I dive deeper into the world of AI agents and modern software development.

## What to Expect

This journal will primarily focus on:

- **AI Agent Development**: Building with and understanding autonomous agents
- **LLM Integration**: Practical applications and patterns
- **Development Workflow**: How AI is changing the way we build software
- **Experiments & Discoveries**: Things that work, things that don't, and lessons learned

## Why Now?

We're at an inflection point in software development. AI agents are no longer just theoretical concepts—they're practical tools that are reshaping how we write code, solve problems, and build applications.

I want to document this journey not just for myself, but to contribute to the collective knowledge of developers navigating this new landscape.

## The Format

Each entry will be:
- **Practical**: Real experiences, not just theory
- **Honest**: Failures and successes alike
- **Concise**: Respecting your time and mine
- **Tagged**: Easy to find related topics

## Let's Build

I'm excited to share this journey. If you're exploring similar topics, I hope these entries prove useful.

More to come soon!
